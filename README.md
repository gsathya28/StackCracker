# StackCracker

StackCracker is a prototype To-Do List App, which I built recreationally to help organize my tasks. 
Still a work in progress, but some of the core functionality I hope to implement in the finished project includes
- Adding/Editing/Deleting a task
- Adding/Deleting a category
- Sorting the tasks by deadline
- Sorting the tasks by category (set by user)
- Including a status regarding the progress of each task (currently not set by user)
